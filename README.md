## Overview

## Dataset
This project focuses on the analsis of of baby name data from the Social Security Adminstration (SSA).  

The data can be downloaded from: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html
    National data: there is a txt file for each year of birth (1881-2022). Columns: name, M/F, and count
    State data: there is a txt file for each state (and DC). Columns: state, M/F, year, name, count.

The national data contains 102,449 unique names. The state data contains 32,722 unique names and the state data has ~12% fewer counts than the national data. Reasons: the state data covers fewer years, and they exclude names with fewer than 5 occurrences in any geographic area.
